# Vim Configuration


## About

I now use NeoVim, so this is old and probably not the most polished, but I'll leave it here.



## Installation

To install my Vim configuration execute this command in your terminal:<br>
NOTE: everithing that is currently in your `~/.vim` and `~/.vimrc` will be backed up into `~/.vim.bak` and `~/.vimrc.bak`
```
. <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juljus/vim-config/main/install.sh)
```

After installation enter Vim, run the commands `:PlugInstall`, `:CocInstall <lang>` and restart Vim.
